## Projects
### Secure File Storage Using Hybrid Cryptography 

This project is a secure encryption system that triple-encrypts files using AES, DES, and RC2 algorithms for enhanced protection. It employs image steganography to conceal encryption keys within images, adding an extra layer of security. The backend, powered by Python, handles encryption and steganography, while the user interface, built with HTML/CSS, ensures a seamless user experience. Using XAMPP for local web hosting and database management, along with FileZilla for secure file transfers, this project delivers a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding sensitive data.

### IOT Based Home Automation

This project entails the development of a home automation system enabling Wi-Fi-based control of home appliances through the Blynk IoT App. It incorporates a NodeMCU (ESP8266 Wi-Fi module) programmed using the Arduino IDE and integrates a 2-channel relay module to ensure safe isolation between the low-voltage control circuit and high-voltage appliances. Additionally, a motor driver module is utilized to convert low-current control signals into high-current outputs for motor operation. This system provides a reliable and scalable solution for modern smart home automation.

## Learning Journey
Throughout my studies in cybersecurity, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and developed hands-on experience with a range of tools and technologies. I have strengthened my skills in network security, cryptography, and threat analysis, while becoming proficient in tools like Wireshark for network analysis, Kali Linux for penetration testing, and Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation.

In addition to foundational concepts, I have worked with machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic and classify it as malicious or normal. I have also gained practical experience in IoT security, file encryption using multiple algorithms, and the integration of image steganography for secure key management.

While I have made significant progress, I still find malware analysis and advanced cryptographic algorithms to be challenging areas. To address this, I plan to focus on hands-on practice, explore specialized courses, participate in capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and collaborate with others in the cybersecurity community to further hone my skills and knowledge.

This journey continues to shape my growth, and I am committed to furthering my expertise in cybersecurity.

## Career Objective
 As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, my goal is to contribute to the protection of digital infrastructures by developing innovative solutions to combat emerging cyber threats. I aim to specialize in areas such as network security, ethical hacking, and cryptography, leveraging my skills in advanced encryption techniques and threat analysis to ensure the security and integrity of data. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I seek to work with organizations to identify vulnerabilities, implement robust security protocols, and respond to cyber incidents. Ultimately, I strive to grow into a cybersecurity expert who can drive strategic security initiatives and protect against evolving cyber risks in a dynamic technological landscape.
