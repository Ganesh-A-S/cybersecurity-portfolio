# Hi, I'm GANESH!

## About Me
A passionate Cybersecurity Enthusiast and Master's student at Universiti Malaya. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Cybersecurity where I am exploring various areas within the field, from network security to machine learning-based security solutions. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C, and C++, and hands-on experience in tools like Kali Linux, Nmap, and Shodan, I aim to contribute to creating safer digital environments.

I am also intrigued by the application of AI and automation in enhancing security systems and regularly work on projects related to vulnerability analysis, network monitoring, and creating intelligent automation bots. My journey into cybersecurity began with an interest in understanding how systems can be exploited, which has evolved into a desire to build solutions that safeguard these systems from vulnerabilities.

I am excited about the intersection of technology and security and am constantly looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge and contribute to the cybersecurity community.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you're interested in collaborating!

## Projects
### Secure File Storage Using Hybrid Cryptography 

This project is a secure encryption system that triple-encrypts files using AES, DES, and RC2 algorithms for enhanced protection. It employs image steganography to conceal encryption keys within images, adding an extra layer of security. The backend, powered by Python, handles encryption and steganography, while the user interface, built with HTML/CSS, ensures a seamless user experience. Using XAMPP for local web hosting and database management, along with FileZilla for secure file transfers, this project delivers a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding sensitive data.

### IOT Based Home Automation

This project entails the development of a home automation system enabling Wi-Fi-based control of home appliances through the Blynk IoT App. It incorporates a NodeMCU (ESP8266 Wi-Fi module) programmed using the Arduino IDE and integrates a 2-channel relay module to ensure safe isolation between the low-voltage control circuit and high-voltage appliances. Additionally, a motor driver module is utilized to convert low-current control signals into high-current outputs for motor operation. This system provides a reliable and scalable solution for modern smart home automation.

### Network Vulnerability Monitoring Dashboard

This repository contains the code for a comprehensive Network Vulnerability Monitoring Dashboard built with Streamlit. It allows users to scan networks for vulnerabilities, fetch details from Shodan.io, visualize vulnerability data, and send automated email reports. The dashboard also features an AI-powered chatbot for querying vulnerabilities and CVE details.

### Features

- **Network Scanning**: 
  - Supports multiple scan modes (Intense Scan, Ping Scan, Comprehensive Scan) using Nmap.
  - Allows users to scan specific IP ranges to identify open ports and services.

- **Vulnerability Detection & Exploit Linking**: 
  - Integrates with Shodan.io to fetch vulnerabilities associated with the detected services.
  - Provides detailed CVE information, including severity scores and exploit links.

- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Visualizes vulnerability severity distributions using interactive charts powered by Plotly.

- **Email Reporting**: 
  - Sends automated email reports containing scan results and vulnerability details.
  - Supports attachments such as vulnerability reports in CSV format.

- **Chatbot Interface**:
  - Users can interact with a chatbot to ask queries about detected vulnerabilities, CVE details, and network scan results.
  - Uses Groq AI to generate real-time responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard for real-time visualization.
- **Nmap**: Tool for network scanning and service identification.
- **Shodan.io API**: Fetches vulnerabilities and exploit details for detected services.
- **Plotly**: Visualizes vulnerability data through interactive charts.
- **Groq AI**: NLP-powered chatbot for querying vulnerabilities.
- **SMTP (Gmail)**: For email report generation and distribution.

## Learning Journey
Throughout my studies in cybersecurity, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and developed hands-on experience with a range of tools and technologies. I have strengthened my skills in network security, cryptography, and threat analysis, while becoming proficient in tools like Wireshark for network analysis, Kali Linux for penetration testing, and Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation.

In addition to foundational concepts, I have worked with machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic and classify it as malicious or normal. I have also gained practical experience in IoT security, file encryption using multiple algorithms, and the integration of image steganography for secure key management.

While I have made significant progress, I still find malware analysis and advanced cryptographic algorithms to be challenging areas. To address this, I plan to focus on hands-on practice, explore specialized courses, participate in capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and collaborate with others in the cybersecurity community to further hone my skills and knowledge.

This journey continues to shape my growth, and I am committed to furthering my expertise in cybersecurity.
